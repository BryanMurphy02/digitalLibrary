# Digital Library
A Goodreads-inspired web application built to practice backend development and database design.  
Digital Library allows users to explore books with detailed information, add them to personal libraries, track their reading progress, rate titles, and record notes.

## Features

- 📚 **Book Catalog** – Browse books with detailed information including title, author, genre, page count, and series.  
- 🗂 **Personal Library** – Add books to a personal library to track your collection.  
- ⏳ **Reading Progress** – Track whether a book is “To Be Read,” “Currently Reading,” or “Completed.”  
- 🗓️ **Reading Calendar** – Track the amount of pages read in a day with specific books.  
- ⭐ **Ratings & Reviews** – Rate books and leave personal notes or reflections.  
- 📝 **Book Notes** – Save quotes, ideas, or thoughts tied to specific books.  
- 👥 **User Accounts (Planned)** – Secure login system to manage individual libraries.  
- 🔍 **Search & Filter (Planned)** – Quickly find books by title, author, or genre.  

## Tech Stack / Built With

- 🐘 **PostgreSQL** – Relational database to store book, user, and library data.  
- 🔗 **psycopg2** – Python library for connecting and interacting with PostgreSQL.  
- 🐍 **Python** – Core backend logic including data access methods (GET/SET).  
- 🌐 **Flask** – Lightweight Python web framework for serving the application.  
- 🎨 **HTML & CSS** – Frontend structure and styling for displaying content.  
- ⚡ **JavaScript (minimal)** – Small enhancements for interactivity.  

## Architecture

The project follows a **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** style architecture to keep the database, backend logic, and frontend display separated and maintainable.  

- 🗄 **Model Layer (Service Layer)**  
  - Handles all interactions with the PostgreSQL database.  
  - Uses **psycopg2** to run queries and return data.  
  - Provides clean `GET` and `SET` methods for the rest of the application.  

- 🔧 **Controller Layer (Routes Layer)**  
  - Implemented with **Flask routes**.  
  - Calls the service layer to fetch or update data.  
  - Converts responses into **JSON format** so the frontend can consume them.  

- 🎨 **View Layer (Frontend)**  
  - Parses JSON data returned from the controller.  
  - Displays book details, libraries, and user interactions using **HTML & CSS**.  
  - Uses minimal **JavaScript** to enhance interactivity.  

### Project Structure

```bash
project-root/
│── app.py             # Flask entry point (controllers / routes)
│── requirements.txt   # Python dependencies
│── /database          # SQL scripts, migrations, ERD diagrams
│── /services          # Model layer: database access methods (psycopg2)
│── /templates         # View layer: HTML templates for Flask
│── /static            # CSS, JS, images
│── /tests             # (Planned) unit tests for backend methods
```

## Usage

After setting up the project (see Installation & Setup), users can:

1. **Run the Application**
```bash
# Activate your virtual environment (if applicable)
# Example for Python venv:
source venv/bin/activate  # Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

# Run Flask app
python app.py
```
